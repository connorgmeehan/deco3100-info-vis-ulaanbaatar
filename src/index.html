  <div class="context_part1">
    <p>PM2.5 is the deadliest form of pollution consisting of miniscule fine particulate matter capable of entering the bloodstream, causing a range of dangerous health consequences. Ulaanbaatar has the fifth highest annual PM2.5 levels in the world despite having a relatively small population and urban extent. Each of the other major cities has annual PM2.5 levels which increase with the number of people and area of land. Despite the ranging levels of population and urban extent, the other cities remain proportional in pollution levels. By comparing Ulaanbaatar to four other cities it is apparent that their pollution problem is uniquely dire, with disproportionately high pollution levels produced in Ulaanbaatar.
