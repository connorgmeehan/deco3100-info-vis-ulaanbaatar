        <p class="Intro_Description">PM2.5 is the deadliest form of pollution consisting of miniscule fine particulate matter capable of entering
          the bloodstream, causing a range of dangerous health consequences. Ulaanbaatar has the fifth highest annual
          PM2.5 levels in the world despite having a relatively small population and urban extent. Each of the other
          major
          cities has annual PM2.5 levels which increase with the number of people and area of land. Despite the ranging
          levels of population and urban extent, the other cities remain proportional in pollution levels. By comparing
          Ulaanbaatar to four other cities it is apparent that their pollution problem is uniquely dire, with
          disproportionately high pollution levels produced in Ulaanbaatar.
